<p>
King Akbar’s son was complimented for his beauty by everyone in the court.
</p> 

<p>
Akbar also agreed to the fact that his son was the most beautiful child in the world but Birbal did not agree.
</p> 

<p>
According to Birbal, Akbar’s son was definitely beautiful but not the most beautiful child in the whole world.
</p>

<p>
Furious,Akbar challenged Birbal to bring to him a child who was more beautiful than his son and prove him wrong.
</p> 

<p>
After a few days, Birbal takes Akbar to a place in the disguise of a common man to meet a poor woman.
</p>

<p>
Though the child is extremely poor and playing in mud, Birbal calls him the most beautiful child in the world.

Akbar refuses this and the child starts to cry. 
</p>

<p>
Listening to this, child’s mother comes out and starts fighting with Akbar and calls her son the most beautiful child in the world. 
</p>

<p>
Then Akbar realizes that for a parent, their own child is always the most beautiful child in the whole world. 
</p>

<p>
